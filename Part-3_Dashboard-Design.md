**PART 3 — Dashboard Design With Boardroom Intent**

**What Is The Purpose?**

Dashboard must help leadership answer 3 business questions:

Are we targeting the right personas?

Are messages working at each funnel stage?

Where should we intervene — messaging or targeting?

This is **strategy monitoring**, not reporting vanity metrics.

**SECTION 1** — Executive Funnel Overview (Top Panel)

**Purpose:**

Instant health check for leadership.

**Metrics To Show:**

Total Leads

MQL Conversion %

SQL Conversion %

Client Conversion %

Cost Per Client (optional)

**Funnel Visualization:**

Lead → MQL → SQL → Client

Add rule:

If drop > 25% → highlight RED

If stable → GREEN

**Why This Exists?**

CEO should know in 5 seconds:

“Is growth pipeline healthy or broken?”

**SECTION 2 — Persona Performance Matrix**

This answers:

Are we targeting the right personas?

**Table Layout:**

| Persona      | Campaign   | MQL % | SQL % | Client % | Status         |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | -------------- |
| D2C CTO      | Campaign A | 42%   | 6%    | 1%       | Trust Gap      |
| Pharma COO   | Campaign B | 38%   | 30%   | 3%       | CTA Weak       |
| SaaS Founder | Campaign C | 12%   | 3%    | 0.5%     | Message Misfit |

**Why This Exists?**

Leadership can instantly see:

Which persona performs

Which one wastes budget

**SECTION 3 — AIDCA Funnel Diagnosis Panel**

This answers:

Which part of the message is failing?

**Layout:**

| Campaign | Attention | Interest | Desire | Conviction | Action | Failure Area |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------ |
| A        | Good      | Good     | Weak   | Weak       | Avg    | Trust Layer  |
| B        | Good      | Avg      | Good   | Good       | Weak   | CTA Stage    |
| C        | Weak      | Weak     | Avg    | Avg        | Avg    | Top Funnel   |

**Color Coding Logic:**

Green = working

Yellow = needs improvement

Red = broken

**Why This Exists?**

Instead of guessing, team knows:

Rewrite headline

Add proof

**SECTION 4 — Leadership Action Panel**


It converts metrics → decisions.

**Rule-Based Suggestions:**

Metric Pattern → Action

High MQL + Low SQL → Add case studies

High SQL + Low Client → Add urgency CTA

Low MQL → Rewrite targeting + subject lines

**Example Buttons (Conceptual):**

Improve Messaging

Change Persona Target

Increase Nurture Flow

Pause Campaign

**Why This Exists?**

Executives don’t want data.

They want what to do next.

**SECTION 5 — Prompt Optimization Tracker (AI Layer)**

This shows AI impact.

**Table:**

| Campaign | Prompt Version | Change Made  | Result Impact   |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| A        | V2             | Added proof  | +15% SQL        |
| B        | V3             | Scarcity CTA | +10% close rate |

**Why This Exists?**

Proves AI is:

Improving performance

Not just writing content


Fix CTA
